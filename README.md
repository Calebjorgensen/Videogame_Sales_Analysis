# Overview

# Videogame Sales Analysis

I am analysis a CSV file that has stored all the data on videogame sales for about the last 40 years. It has year of release, name, sales, publisher and more.

The purpose of this software is to get insights in what videogame companies and publishers we should take interested in based on there sales and games.

# Data Analysis Results

1. What is video games sold the most from year to year.
2. Which publisher has the most sales?

# Development Environment

I used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, Git

I use Python for it simple and straight forward syntax. And as I was using python I use pandas for my libraries, because they work well together.

# Future Work

* I want to make it is so that the bar graph is also color coordinated to follow publishers.
* Make it so that you can API to the CSV file and not have to download and it store it.
